This piece is a classical Loop in Loop double overlap chain, of the style produced by the Greeks and Romans in ancient times. each pure silver loop in the chain is hand turned, cut, butted, fused, shaped and then woven into the chain. The chain is then annealed and trued by hand. A 50cm chain takes approximately 10 metres (35 ft) of wire and 3 days to complete.
